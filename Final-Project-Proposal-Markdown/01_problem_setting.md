# Problem Setting

Urban public transit systems serve as critical infrastructure in cities worldwide, carrying millions of passengers daily across networks of fixed routes and schedules. Efficient operation of these systems depends on the ability to anticipate passenger demand at fine spatial and temporal granularity. When transit agencies can predict how many riders will board at a given stop during a given time window, they can make better decisions about vehicle dispatching, driver scheduling, route frequency adjustments, and real-time capacity management.

Despite the importance of demand prediction, most publicly available transit datasets are aggregated at the route or day level, limiting the resolution at which models can learn and predict. Ridership totals reported per route per day, for example, obscure the significant variation that occurs across stops, times of day, and days of the week. This aggregation gap means that models trained on such data cannot capture the stop-level demand fluctuations that matter most for operational decisions.

Recent advances in onboard sensor technology have begun to close this gap. Modern transit vehicles increasingly carry GPS receivers, automatic passenger counters, door sensors, and environmental monitors that record operational state at second-level resolution. These sensor streams, when properly synchronized and recorded over extended periods, produce datasets rich enough to support fine-grained demand modeling. The challenge shifts from data availability to feature construction and model selection: how to transform raw sensor streams into meaningful predictive features, and which classification or regression frameworks best exploit the spatiotemporal structure of transit operations.

This project addresses that challenge using the ZTBus dataset, a publicly available collection of second-resolved driving missions from the Zurich trolleybus network. The dataset spans over three years of operations across two vehicles and two routes, providing the temporal depth and operational detail necessary to develop and evaluate demand prediction models that generalize beyond a single city or transit system.
