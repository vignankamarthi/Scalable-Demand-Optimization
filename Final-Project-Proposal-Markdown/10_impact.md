# Impact of the Project Outcomes

Accurate short-term demand prediction has direct operational value for public transit agencies. When agencies can anticipate which stops will experience high ridership during specific time windows, they can allocate resources more effectively: deploying larger vehicles or increasing service frequency on high-demand segments, reducing empty-seat kilometers on low-demand runs, and improving the passenger experience by reducing overcrowding and wait times.

The classification framework developed in this project is designed to be transferable. The feature set relies on signals -- time of day, stop location, door events, vehicle speed, temperature -- that are standard outputs of modern onboard sensor suites. Any transit agency with automatic passenger counting (APC) infrastructure can construct an equivalent feature set from their own operational data, retrain the models on local ridership patterns, and deploy stop-level demand predictions tailored to their network. The methodology is not tied to Zurich's trolleybus system or its specific route geometry.

From a broader perspective, improving public transit efficiency contributes to urban sustainability. Better demand prediction enables service designs that attract ridership by reducing overcrowding and improving reliability, which in turn reduces private vehicle dependence, lowers per-capita emissions, and supports equitable access to transportation. Data-driven transit optimization is a lever that scales across cities and transit modalities, and this project demonstrates one concrete application of classification-based demand modeling toward that goal.
